# WCAG React Components
### Web Accessibility, or A11y, is the design of pages, tools, and technoglogies on the web that are built for everyone to use, regardless of ability or disability. Web development with an emphasis on accessibility ensures inclusion of the entire population that uses the web. I am passionate about adding accessibile features to apps and pages that I develop. By building reusable React Componenets that pass A11y audits and requirements, I will be both learning about A11y features and requirements, while simultaneously building reuseable components for reuse in future React applications. 

# App Component
1. Document has a <title> element
2. <html> element has a [lang] attribute
3. <html> element has a valid value for its [lang] attribute
4. [user-scalable="no"] is not used in the <meta name="viewport"> element and the [maximum-scale] attribute is not less than 5.

# Button Component
### Passed Audits in Google Chrome
1. [aria-*] attributes match their roles
2. [aria-*] attributes have valid values
3. [aria-*] attributes are valid and not misspelled
4. Buttons have an accessible name
5. Background and foreground colors have a sufficient contrast ratio
6. No element has a [tabindex] value greater than 0
